In this paper, we want to understand people’s perception towards food with respect to their background, and use this as the context to evaluate food-based AI systems in future. Therefore, we conducted first-of-its-kind survey on perception about food available in India at educational institutes from participants who may associate themselves with different regions within and outside India.
